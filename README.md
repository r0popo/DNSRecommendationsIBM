### Installation<a name="installation"></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
In the [IBM Watson Studio](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-studio?utm_content=SRCWW&p1=Search&p4=43700067990304608&p5=e&gclid=CjwKCAiApvebBhAvEiwAe7mHSJ1IuoLFyKwhgQo26GV_6x42-x_LP6z-8PURzxO9_YshvaPkWZvbeRoCpw8QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds), there is a large collaborative community ecosystem of articles, datasets, notebooks, and other A.I. and ML. assets. Users of the system interact with all of this.
For this project, I created a recommendation system to enhance the user experience and connect users with assets. I applied a number of different methods for making recommendations that can be used for different situations in order to analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles they might like

## File Descriptions<a name="files"></a>
Jupyter notebook available in this repository showcases work related to the development of the recommendation system. The notebook includes exploratory data analysis and a number of different recommendation methods such as rank-based, content-based and collaborative filtering. Markdown cells were used to add context and outline the thought process for individual steps.

data/ directory contains two csv files related to the assets and user-item interactions provided by the IBM Watson Studio.
